* downloaded and installed VSCode and Go. 
* got YouTube API Key and OAuth
* fooled around with the YouTube Go example code
  - included looking through the source code to understand what was happening/how they were reaching the REST endpoint
  - ultimately remained confused until looking at the API documentation (in general, for all languages) online
  - then I realized the scope of the API and that the package created for Go contains helper methods to execute these API calls
  - => thus, no need to manually determine URLs for the API. Go methods do it for you!
* modified the example code to start accessing different types of channel data y using the channel Id rather than username
* figured out how to turn channel info into JSON and print that JSON to the console
* NOTE: not all channels have easily determined IDs. Should create a helper API call to get channel ID based on username
* channel info does not include a list of related channels - will need to write custom scraper to get that info!!

Next steps:
* build UI to visualize channel relationships
* build scraper to get related channels
* create helper methods for common sets of API calls
* access my own account data and figure out what can be accessed
